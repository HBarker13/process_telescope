"""There aren't flats for every night. I've kept the flats in directories according to the night they were made to avoid more confusion with the filters used on Night 1. I have kept the same labelling as was used in the observing log (ie. with the incorrect filter names.) The corrections are:
	U -> V
	B -> R
	V -> I
	R -> RG delta50 ?
	I -> Bessel z
I have deviated from the wording on the observing log and named all the flatfields 'flat', rather than 'sky'
